Binomial Coefficient Calculator
===============================

This is just a toy implementation of the [n-choose-k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient)
function. Maybe it is not the most efficient implementation
as it was just a quick hack. Optionally by setting

    #define USE_GMP 1

the [GNU Multiple Precision Library](http://libgmp.org) can
be used to calculate arbitrary large binomial coefficients.
